# User-Specific Data Display in Dashboard

This update ensures that user data is properly displayed in the dashboard:

1. Dashboard components now use the authenticated user's ID to fetch data
2. DailyLogs component receives and uses the user ID for API requests
3. DailySummary component properly filters data by user ID
4. API endpoints support user ID filtering

This completes the user-specific data implementation, ensuring that:
- Each user only sees their own data
- Authentication is required to access protected routes
- Database operations include the user_id parameter
